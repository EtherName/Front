it should be for free. New trend example by premium photos, from couple premium photobanks is, that also these premium photos, for which you pay, <span class="r-medium">you don’t have permission to use it
as you want.</span> Nonsense. Really stupid. Also by free pictures. On internet you can find many free pictures. But almost at all you have to contact the author for permission and have to use 
the author’s copyright at the picture. Nonsense. Really. Stupid. What is than free? Nothing. Free should be free. Without stupid obligations. <span class="r-medium under">We have really free stuff. Without stupid licences ;)</span>
